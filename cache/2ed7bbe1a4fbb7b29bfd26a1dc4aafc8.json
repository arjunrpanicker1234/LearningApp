It does not perform any type checking, so it can return true even if the types are different. On the other hand, `is` checks if both variables refer to the same object in memory. This is often used for comparing complex objects or nested data structures.\"\n    }\n]", "timestamp": "2025-04-01T08:32:09.665501", "prompt": "\n        Generate 2 multiple-choice questions about Python at difficulty level 3/5.\n        Format t...", "model": "llama3.2:3b"}
